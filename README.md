# Hadoop-MapReduce-Programs

Contains the WordCount MapReduce Java program which is there on Apache MapReduce tutorial
(https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html#Example%3A+WordCount+v1.0).

On similar lines, I have written MapReduce program for calculating Maximum Temperature of each City.
The input files should be in the following format :-

city1 temp1 \n
city2 temp2 \n
city1 temp3 \n
city3 temp4 \n
